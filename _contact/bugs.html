<h2 class="text-light">Where can I report typos?</h2>
<p>
  If you're just reporting a typo on this website, please make a Pull Request on the <a href="https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/wolfram-client.tk">Wolfram website's repository</a> that fixes the typo.
</p>
<p>
  On some pages you might also find a comments section and/or an "edit" button. You can use those to report/fix typos - and it's usually the fastest way to do that.
</p>
<p>
  This doesn't apply to typos within the client itself, however. For those, you can send me an email.
</p>
<h2 class="text-light">Where can I report bugs?</h2>
<p>
  We will eventually have some kind of bug tracker, but for now, you can report bugs via email.
</p>
<p>
  If you are reporting a crash, <b>always include the crash report file</b>! Crash reports are completely useless without that file. If you don't include it, your report will be ignored.
</p>
<p>
  Also tell me know you managed to get that crash. Simply dumping the crash log into an email is usually not enough.
</p>
<h2 class="text-light">Still interested?</h2>
