title: Reporting Bugs
---
<p>
  We use our GitHub issue tackers to handle bug reports, but we don't accept bug reports submitted through anything else. Do NOT email me about bugs!
</p>
<p>
  If you're just reporting a typo on this website, you can simply make a Pull Request on the <a href="/github/website/">Wolfram website repository</a> that fixes the typo. That's not possible with typos inside the client, though. You will need to make a bug report for those.
</p>
<p>
  If you are reporting a crash, <b>always include the crash report file</b>! Crash reports are completely useless without that file, so if you don't include it, we will ban your account.
</p>
<p>
  Here's a <a href="/github/">list of our Wolfram-related GitHub repositories</a>. Find the one that's right for your bug report, read through the rules and then open an issue there. You will also need a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
