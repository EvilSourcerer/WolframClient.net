## Changelog

- Added MobSpawnESP hack: Highlights areas where mobs can spawn. A yellow cross indicates that mobs can spawn at night, while a red one means that mobs can spawn at any time. (MC 1.9.4, 1.10, 1.11 & 1.12)

- AutoFish will now recognize enchantments and automatically select your best fishing rod.

- Fixed the cross-platform Wolfram installer not working with Java 9 and 10.
