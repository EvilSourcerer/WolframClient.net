## Changelog

- Added Watchdog Bypass: Bypasses Watchdog, Gwen, etc. by preventing KillAura from attacking their fake entities. Enabled by default. Can be disabled by unchecking the "Watchdog Bypass" checkbox in the KillAura window.

  _Notice: If you don't have that checkbox, you can get it by resetting the GUI to its defaults (GUI Options > Presets > Default)._

- Redesigned PlayerESP: It's now a simple box rather than a round cage, making it much easier to see the actual player inside of the ESP frame and also making it less laggy when a lot of players are nearby.

- Added default settings for X-Ray

- Fixed FreeCam getting stuck in walls

- Fixed list GUIs (Account Manager, X-Ray Manager, etc.) not rendering properly
