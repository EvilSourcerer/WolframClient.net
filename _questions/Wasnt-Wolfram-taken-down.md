title: Wasn't Wolfram taken down by some big company?

This is a tough question to answer, as I'm not allowed to talk about this topic in detail.

All I can say is that it won't happen again. Trusted sources told me that there won't be another attempt to take Wolfram down, but even if that information is wrong and there will be another attempt, then I will be prepared for that.

Should Mojang or WolframAlpha have any problems with the Wolfram Client, I will change it appropriately. Wolfram will not collapse under my lead.
