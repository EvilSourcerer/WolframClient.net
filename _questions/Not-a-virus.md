title: How do I know that this is not a virus?
---
There are several ways how you can prove to yourself that Wolfram is not a virus:

1. **Scan it.**

    Use whatever antivirus software you have, they will all tell you, just like I do, that Wolfram is clean.

    If you want to take it a step further, I recommend using <a href="https://virustotal.com/" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a>. It's a free service that scans files using over 50 different antivirus programs, including Kaspersky.

2. **Read the source code.**

    Wolfram is not obfuscated, we have nothing to hide. Feel free to analyze it with whatever decompiler you have. Please read the [Wolfram Client License](/license/) for details on what you can and cannot do with Wolfram and its code.

    If you don't have a decompiler, my favorite is <a href="http://bytecodeviewer.com/" target="_blank">BytecodeViewer</a>.

3. **Social proof.**

    - Wolfram is trusted by and featured on <a href="http://www.wizardhax.com/wolfram/" target="_blank">WiZARDHAX.com</a>, the largest and most popular network of Minecraft hacked clients in the world.

    - Wolfram is maintained by the <a href="http://wurst-imperium.tk" target="_blank">Wurst-Imperium</a>. We have been in this business for years and are trusted and loved by millions of users all over the world.
