  First off, I'd like to let you know that we get way more suggestions than we can actually implement. So it's probably going to take quite a while until we get to your suggestion, provided that we accept it at all.
</p>
<p>
  Second, we only use our GitHub issue tackers to handle suggestions - and we don't accept suggestions submitted through anything else. <strong>Do NOT email me about suggestions!</strong> If you do, I'll ignore the suggestion and mark your email as spam.
</p>
<p>
  Third, each one of our issue trackers has its own set of rules that you have to follow. If you don't, we will ban your account from <em>all</em> of our issue trackers. Make sure that you read and understand those rules before posting anything.
</p>
<p>
  Still interested? Here's a <a href="/github/">list of our Wolfram-related GitHub repositories</a>. Find the one that's right for your suggestion, read through the rules and then open an issue there. You will also need a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
